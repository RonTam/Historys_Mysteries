### Introduction

Game-Based Learning represents a pedagogical approach to education that offers students a level of engagement and motivation that cannot be easily replicated in the traditional classroom approach. Our team’s goal is to design a gaming app that can teach users about history without the monotony of dates and memorization found in the classic textbook learning setting. Specifically, History’s Mysteries will have episodes that focus on the history of a particular location. For our project, we create a fictitious storyline that takes place in lower Manhattan of New York City.
